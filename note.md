## A Guide to Designing Function

- Give each function exactly one job, but make it apply to many related situations
- Donâ€™t repeat yourself (DRY): Implement a process just once, but execute it many times
- Defines function **generally**

## Higher-order functions

- Express general mothods of computation
- Remove repetition from programs
- Separate concerns among functions

## Some benefit of using lambda expression

- Make the name space clean
- Replace a function when it is simple

Notice: lambda don't gave you more power and you do not need to write it at all.

## How to Draw an Environment Diagram

When a function is defined

1. Create a function value: func \<name\>(\<formal parameters\>) \[parent=\<label\>\]
   Its parent is the current frame.
2. Bind \<name\> to the function value in the current frame

When a function is called

1. Add a local frame, titled with the \<name\> of the function being called.
2. Copy the parent of the function to the local frame: \[parent=\<label\>\]
3. Bind the \<formal parameters\> to the arguments in the local frame.
4. Execute the body of the function in the environment that starts with the local frame.

## Choose Function's Name

- Names should convey the meaning or purpose of the values to which they are bound.
- The type of value bound to the name is best documented in a function's docstring.
- Function names typically convey their effect (`print`), their behavior (`triple`), or the value returned (`abs`).

## What happens when you call Recursion Function

- The same function `fact` is called multiple times
- Different frames keep track of the different arguments in each call
- What `n` evaluates to depends upon the current environment
- Each call to `fact` solves a simpler problem than the last: smaller `n`

## The Recursive Leap of Faith

1. Verify the base case
2. Treat `fact` as a functional abstraction!
3. Assume that `fact(n-1)` is correct
4. Verify that `fact(n)` is correct

## Converting Recursion to Iteration

Can be tricky: Iteration is a special case of recursion.

Idea: Figure out what state must be maintained by the iterative function.

## Converting Iteration to Recursion

More formulaic: Iteration is a special case of recursion.

Idea: The state of an iteration can be passed as arguments.

## Data Abstraction

- Lets us manipulate compound values as units
- Isolate two parts of any program that uses data
  - How data are represented (as parts)
  - How data are manipulated (as units)
