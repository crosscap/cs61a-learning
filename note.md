## A Guide to Designing Function

- Give each function exactly one job, but make it apply to many related situations
- Donâ€™t repeat yourself (DRY): Implement a process just once, but execute it many times
- Defines function **generally**

## Higher-order functions

- Express general mothods of computation
- Remove repetition from programs
- Separate concerns among functions

## Some benefit of using lambda expression

- Make the name space clean
- Replace a function when it is simple

Notice: lambda don't gave you more power and you do not need to write it at all.
